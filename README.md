# importDrumkv1
Bash script to easily import a drum kit in [drumkv1](https://drumkv1.sourceforge.io/) (an old-school drum-kit sampler for linux)

To work :
All the samples need to be in the same folder  
The .drumkv1 file you create with the script need to be in the same folder than the samples  
You need (if it is not already) to install [zenity](https://github.com/GNOME/zenity)  

To use :  
Download importDrumkv1.sh  
Make it executable  
Select the folder with the samples you want in your drumkit  
Give a name to the corresponding .drumkv1 file (place it in the same folder)  

Now, open drumkv1 -> Open preset -> select the .drumkv1 file you have just made.  

REMARK : it will be a very basic file, but it's a start to customize it...
